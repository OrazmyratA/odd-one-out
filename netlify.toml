# Netlify Build Configuration for Angular

[build]
  # 1. Build Command: Runs the Angular production build, referencing the 
  # production configuration in your angular.json.
  command = "npm run build -- --configuration production"
  
  # 2. Publish Directory: Must match the outputPath defined in angular.json (production configuration).
  publish = "dist/odd-one-out/browser"

# 3. Routing Rule for Single Page Applications (SPAs)
# This ensures that direct access to deep links (like /about or /dashboard)
# serves index.html with a 200 status, allowing the Angular Router to take over.
